# animMorph Script for DAZ Studio 

This script helps to import animations from Marvelous Designer into DAZ Studio. I've explained the whole process in these articles:

- [Exporting Animations from DAZ Studio for use in Marvelous Designer](https://www.versluis.com/2015/03/how-to-export-animations-from-daz-studio-for-use-in-marvelous-designer/)

There's also a YouTube video that describes the process:

# History

This nifty script was made by several authors. 

- originally concept provided by DREDMARK
- then greatly overhauled by marcuswilm
- promoted by marcuswilm and myself in various online places (since 2015)

Marcus was kind enough to host this scritp as a [Gist on GitGithub](https://gist.github.com/marcuswilm/c2305cd494d54b9aba80bf5f43d0f7bf). We had quite a little discussion on that thread. Until DAZ Studio 4.11, the original version of the script worked fine.

Since DAZ Studio 4.12, an update was needed, so ThePhilosopher reached out to the DAZ Community, where the script was tweaked (let me know who did it so I can give credit here). To make updates future proof, I've created this repo so we can offer releases and use pull requests and branches for community coding.

# Usage
To keep it simple, I've added both versions into this repo. Pick either the DS411 or the DS412 version (for DAZ Studio 4.11 or 4.12 respectively). Download the file, then save it into the scripts folder in your DAZ Studio library. Head over to the Content Library tab and execute it.

More details and license coming soon :-)
