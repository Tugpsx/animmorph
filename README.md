# animMorhp Script for DAZ Studio 

This script helps to import animations from Marvelous Designer into DAZ Studio. I've explained the whole process in these articles:

- https://www.versluis.com/2015/03/how-to-export-garment-animations-from-marvelous-designer-for-use-in-daz-studio/

Part of this process is this nifty community script. Originally provided by DREDMARK them greatly overhauled by marcuswilm and promoted by myself in various places. Marcus was kind enough to host this scritp as a Gist on GitGithub. Until DAZ Studio 4.11, Version 1 of the script worked fine.

Since DAZ Studio 4.12, an update was needed, so ThePhilosopher reached out to the DAZ Community, where the script was tweaked (let me know who did it so I can give credit here). To make updates future proof, I've created this repo so we can offer releases and use pull requests and branches for community coding.

More details and license coming soon :-)
